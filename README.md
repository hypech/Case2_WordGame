# Case2_WordGame

Android Studio enables us to quickly build layouts by dragging UI elements into a visual design editor instead of writing layout XML by hand. The design editor can preview your layout on different Android devices and versions, and you can dynamically resize the layout to be sure it works well on different screen sizes.

In this case, we learn how to use the Android Studio Layout Editor to create a layout that includes a text box and a button, how to make the app send the content of the text box to another widget when the button is tapped, and how to change the design of the widget. We will learn different UI Design techniques, patterns & principles.
